As a data scientist and machine learning engineer with a Ph.D. in Computer Science, I bring a wealth of expertise in spearheading and advancing cutting-edge projects. My focus lies in leveraging advanced MLOps, statistical modeling, machine learning, and data analysis techniques to unearth actionable insights and deploy data-driven solutions within commercialized cloud-based environments. With a deep-rooted commitment to the realms of data science and academic innovation, I actively contribute to prestigious conferences and journals such as NeurIPS and Pattern Recognition, consistently pushing the boundaries of knowledge and discovery.

Professional Experience
======
## Senior Data Scientist
### [AGL Energy](https://www.agl.com.au/about-agl) (October 2022 - April 2024)
During my time at AGL Energy, a prominent utility company commanding over half of the market share in Australia, I led a team of seven data scientists, guiding them through the intricacies of end-to-end data science and MLOps solutions. From the initial stages of pitching ideas to the final stages of post-deployment support, I facilitated every aspect of the process. Over the course of my tenure, I spearheaded the design, development, and delivery of more than ten scalable cloud-based data-driven solutions, each tailored to meet the company's evolving needs. Ensuring seamless alignment with business objectives, I adeptly communicated the results and insights gleaned from our endeavors to stakeholders.

Among my notable achievements were the initiation of multiple Gen-AI proof of concepts, which yielded substantial enhancements across various facets of AGL's operations. Additionally, I engineered a remarkable 50% reduction in pilot-to-production duration by introducing internally developed Python packages and toolkits. Through the implementation of robust logging and model monitoring pipelines, I slashed the Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) of maintenance tickets by an impressive 70%. Furthermore, I eradicated ingestion pipeline failures by establishing a DataBricks feature store, integrating PySpark, and deploying MLOps stacks. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), I orchestrated a notable 40% reduction in service desk time allocation, showcasing the transformative impact of cutting-edge techniques in our operational efficiency.

## Data Scientist Researcher
### [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/)/ [Ford Company](https://www.ford.com/) (June 2021 - October 2022)
At RMIT University and Ford Company, I led a team of 5 engineers and researchers in implementing a versatile quality control technology. Our collaborative efforts focused on detecting defects in industrial parts, thereby increasing company revenue. Leveraging domain adaptation methods and deep neural networks, including ResNet50 as the backbone, I utilized tools like PyTorch, OpenCV, and Torch-vision to achieve efficient defect detection.

## Machine Learning Specialist
### [Keylead Health](https://keyleadhealth.com) (January 2021 - June 2021)
During my tenure at Keylead Health, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to analyze healthcare data, aiming to enhance clinical trial and medical research processes. Working alongside data engineers and clinicians, I contributed to the development of strategies to improve healthcare outcomes.
